## Core Capabilities

### 🎤 **6 Processing Modes**

VODER offers six distinct voice processing modes, each designed for specific audio transformation needs:

| Mode | Description | Input | Output |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **STT+TTS** | Speech-to-Text then Text-to-Speech | Audio | Audio |
| **TTS** | Text-to-Speech with Voice Design | Text | Audio |
| **TTS+VC** | Text-to-Speech + Voice Cloning | Text + Reference | Audio |
| **STS** | Speech-to-Speech (Voice Conversion) | Audio + Reference | Audio |
| **TTM** | Text-to-Music Generation | Text | Audio |
| **TTM+VC** | Text-to-Music + Voice Conversion | Text + Reference | Audio |

### 🎭 **Dialogue System**

VODER features a powerful **row-based dialogue editor** designed for creating multi-speaker audio content such as podcasts, AI news broadcasts, audiobooks, and conversational content. This system enables script-based generation where multiple characters speak with distinct voices in a cohesive narrative flow.

**GUI Dialogue Input:**
- Each line is a separate row with **Character** and **Dialogue** fields.
- New rows are added automatically when you fill the last row.
- First row has no delete button; subsequent rows can be deleted individually.
- Voice prompts or audio assignments appear dynamically for every character found in the script.

**Optional Background Music:**
- When generating dialogue (TTS or TTS+VC mode), VODER can automatically **add ambient background music** that matches the length of the spoken audio.
- A clean dialog appears before processing, asking: *“Enter music description (or press Skip):”*
- If a description is provided (e.g., `"soft piano, cinematic strings"`), VODER:
  - Generates music via ACE-Step using the description as style prompt and `"..."` as empty lyrics.
  - Automatically fits the music duration to the exact length of the dialogue.
  - Mixes the music at **35% volume** relative to the dialogue.
  - Cleans up temporary files and saves the final result with an `_m` suffix (e.g., `voder_tts_dialogue_..._m.wav`).
- If the user skips, processing proceeds normally without music.

This feature is available in both **GUI** and **CLI** modes (interactive and one‑line). It is **only triggered for dialogue scripts** (i.e., more than one line, or a single line containing a colon).

**Example Script (conceptual):**
```plaintext
James: Welcome to our podcast! Today we'll explore AI advances.
Sarah: Thanks James! I'm excited to discuss my latest research.
James: Let's dive in. First, tell us about neural networks.
```

**Key Features:**
- Multi-character script support with real-time character extraction
- Individual voice prompts for each character (TTS mode)
- Reference audio assignment per character via dropdown numbers (TTS+VC mode)
- **Optional background music** – automatically generated, duration‑fitted, volume‑controlled
- Automatic audio concatenation with proper pacing
- Ideal for podcasts, news segments, interviews, and storytelling

The dialogue system is available in both **TTS** (Voice Design) and **TTS+VC** (Voice Cloning) modes, allowing you to create voices either through descriptive prompts or by cloning from real audio samples.

### 🔧 **AI Model Integration**

VODER leverages state-of-the-art open-source models for professional-grade audio processing:

- **Speech Recognition:** [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) — Whisper for accurate audio transcription
- **Voice Synthesis:** [QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) — Qwen3-TTS for natural text-to-speech
- **Voice Conversion:** [Plachtaa/seed-vc](https://github.com/Plachtaa/seed-vc) — Seed-VC for speech-to-speech transformation
- **Music Generation:** [ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) — ACE-Step for lyrics-to-music synthesis

## Usage Guide

### GUI Mode

1. Launch: `python src/voder.py`
2. Select mode from dropdown (6 available modes)
3. Load input files based on mode:
   - **STT+TTS:** Load base audio (content), then load target audio (voice)
   - **TTS:** Enter dialogue row‑by‑row in the script area, and fill the automatically generated voice prompts for each character  
     **Optional:** Before generation, a dialog will ask if you want background music; enter a description or press Skip.
   - **TTS+VC:** Enter dialogue rows, load voice reference audio files (each assigned a number), then assign each character an audio number via dropdown  
     **Optional:** The same background music dialog appears before generation.
   - **STS:** Load base audio and target voice audio
   - **TTM:** Enter lyrics and style prompt
   - **TTM+VC:** Enter lyrics, style prompt, and load target voice audio
4. Click **"Generate"** (TTS/TTS+VC/TTM/TTM+VC) or **"Patch"** (STT+TTS/STS)
5. Listen to output and save results

### CLI Mode (Interactive)
```bash
python src/voder.py cli
```
The interactive CLI now supports full dialogue creation:
- Enter multiple lines (empty line to finish).
- Lines without a colon → **single mode** (one text, one voice prompt/audio).
- Lines with colon (`Character: text`) → **dialogue mode**.
- VODER will ask for a voice prompt (TTS) or audio file path (TTS+VC) for each character, in order.
- **After** collecting all voice prompts/assignments, you will be asked:  
  `Add background music? (y/N):`  
  If you answer `y` or `yes`, you can enter a music description.  
  Leaving the description blank or entering empty skips the music.

### One-Line Commands
One‑line commands now support **dialogue mode** through repeated `script`, `voice`, and `target` parameters, as well as the optional **`music`** parameter for background music.

**Single mode examples:**
```bash
# Text-to-Speech
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "female, cheerful"

# Text-to-Speech with Voice Cloning
python src/voder.py tts+vc script "Hello" target "voice.wav"

# Speech-to-Speech Voice Conversion
python src/voder.py sts base "input.wav" target "voice.wav"

# Text-to-Music
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Verse 1: ..." styling "upbeat pop" 30

# Text-to-Music with Voice Conversion
python src/voder.py ttm+vc lyrics "..." styling "pop" 30 target "voice.wav"
```

**Dialogue mode examples (TTS):**
```bash
# Without background music
python src/voder.py tts \
  script "James: Welcome to the show!" \
  script "Sarah: Glad to be here." \
  voice "James: deep male voice, authoritative" \
  voice "Sarah: bright female voice, energetic"

# With background music
python src/voder.py tts \
  script "James: Welcome to the show!" \
  script "Sarah: Glad to be here." \
  voice "James: deep male voice, authoritative" \
  voice "Sarah: bright female voice, energetic" \
  music "soft piano, cinematic"
```

**Dialogue mode examples (TTS+VC):**
```bash
# Without background music
python src/voder.py tts+vc \
  script "James: Let's start with AI." \
  script "Sarah: I've been working on this for years." \
  target "James: /path/to/james_voice.wav" \
  target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah_voice.wav"

# With background music
python src/voder.py tts+vc \
  script "James: Let's start with AI." \
  script "Sarah: I've been working on this for years." \
  target "James: /path/to/james_voice.wav" \
  target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah_voice.wav" \
  music "ambient electronic, chill"
```

**Note:** STT+TTS mode is not available in one-line CLI because it requires interactive text editing.  
If the `music` parameter is supplied in single‑mode (plain text without colon), it is ignored with a warning.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU | 4-6 cores |
| GPU | 8GB+ VRAM (NVIDIA) |
| RAM | 16GB system memory |
| Storage | SSD recommended |

### Recommended Requirements

VODER is designed to maximize output quality rather than speed. Meeting the minimum requirements ensures reliable operation — the focus is on achieving professional-grade audio results, not processing benchmarks. Higher VRAM allows for longer audio generation and more complex workflows.
